# Algorithm-Studies

While in school at Coding Dojo I am working through a book of algorithm challanges and makeing them a part of my everyday 
routine. Goal: Starting from the basic building blocks and learning the functionality of what goes on below the surface of 
methods that we can simply call like .concat() will help me make better choices in the future about how I build/write my code 
so as to optimize for best preformance practice. Goal 2: building up a base of logic skills to be able to easily handle more 
complex algorithms in the future.
